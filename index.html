		<p class="welcome">
			Welcome to the official webpage of Christian Gibson, current software
			development student at Western Governors University and lifelong learner. Nothing on this site was set up via templates,
			everything you see here is written by myself in HTML, CSS or Javascript using
			knowledge from my software development program, official browser documentation, and other sources I've
			picked up along the way. I have spent the past year learning C# and C++ on my own; and have been able
			to create a few applications to show my competency. This, coupled with my current software development program,
			will make me a stronger developer and hopefully a valuable asset to any company.
			Feel free to browse and learn more about myself and what I'd like to accomplish
			in this very wide world of development. Use the links below to navigate, and feel free to reach out to me. My website is
			hosted by GitHub.
